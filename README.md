> Google Cloud Project Django for Mental Health Technology Health Transfer Network

This is a template that will get you started to deploy a Flask application
on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app/writing-web-service)! 
See the [documentation](https://vsoch.github.io/mhttc) to get started.

## Questions and TODO

 - what information should go on the front page?
 - does other centers (with only access to projects) mean no access to training resources?

## Thanks

This application uses the following open source or creative commons resources:

 - [DrawKit](https://www.drawkit.io/)
