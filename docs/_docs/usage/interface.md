# Interface

The front page of the interface currently shows limited information, but
gives the anonymous user access to social media links. There is a prominent
login form.

Once the user has logged in, the login panel changes to a user settings panel.

Under interfaces are under development.

## Projects

So far, we have a basic page to create a new project.
