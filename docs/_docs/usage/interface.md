# Interface

The front page of the interface currently shows limited information, but
gives the anonymous user access to social media links. There is a prominent
login form.

<br>

Once the user has logged in, the login panel changes to a user settings panel.

## Users

<br>


## Centers

Each center has a basic page with information

<br>

<br>

and easy access to projects and trainings

<br>

<br>

Each center can have one or more training events (these events are the ones
that will have associated certificates for participants to download).

## Information

### Contact

A contact form is driven by Formspree to easily contact the site main contact:

### About

The about page has basic links to the software and documentation. This page would
do well to have more information about MHTTC.

Other interfaces are under development.

## Projects

So far, we have a basic page to create a new project.

<br>

![interface-new-project.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-new-project.png)


<br>

and then view the project details. Note that each project has an associated form
template, which the user should move through in stages.

![interface-project.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-project.png)


The view for the form is still under development.
