# Interface

The front page of the interface currently shows limited information, but
gives the anonymous user access to social media links. There is a prominent
login form.

<br>

Once the user has logged in, the login panel changes to a user settings panel.

<br>

![interface-login.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-login.png)

<br>

And the user profile looks like this:

<br>

![interface-profile.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-profile.png)

<br>

Under interfaces are under development.

## Projects

So far, we have a basic page to create a new project.
