# Interface

The front page of the interface currently shows limited information, but
gives the anonymous user access to social media links. There is a prominent
login form.

## Users

By default, a user cannot make their own account. An administrative user
should go to their Profile and under Admin settings, enter a list of emails
to send invitations to:

TODO MAKE THIS VIEW CREATE IMAGE

The users are then notified via email with an email login and temporary password.
By way of doing this via email we also verify the email address.

TODO TAKE PICTURE OF EMAIL

At the onset of logging in, the user is first asked to agree to the privacy policy
and terms of service. 

<br>

<br>

These terms are always available via a link in the footer. The content itself
is maintained in a Google Document so updating it doesn't require updating the 
site itself.

<br>

Once the user has logged in, the login panel changes to a user settings panel.

## Users

The user profile looks like this:

<br>

<br>


## Centers

There is a main listing of centers, which doesn't serve much use other than to
show what exists:

<br>

![interface-centers.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-centers.png)

<br>


Each center has a basic page with information (what might be useful to add here?)

<br>

![interface-center.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-center.png)

<br>

and easy access to projects and trainings

<br>

![interface-center-projects.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-center-projects.png)

<br>

Each center can have one or more training events (these events are the ones
that will have associated certificates for participants to download).

<br>



## Information

### Contact

A contact form is driven by Formspree to easily contact the site main contact:

<br>

![interface-contact.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-contact.png)


### About

The about page has basic links to the software and documentation. This page would
do well to have more information about MHTTC.

<br>

Other interfaces are under development.

## Projects

So far, we have a basic page to create a new project.

<br>

![interface-new-project.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-new-project.png)


<br>

and then view the project details. Note that each project has an associated form
template, which the user should move through in stages.

![interface-project.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/img/interface-project.png)


The view for the form is still under development.
